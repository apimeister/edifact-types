0.    INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the
       Bayplan/stowage plan occupied and empty locations message
       (BAPLIE) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
       between trading partners involved in administration, commerce
       and transport.

1.    SCOPE

1.1   Functional Definition

       A message to transmit information about equipment and goods on
       a means of transport, including their location on the means of
       transport. The message can be exchanged between (liner's)
       agents, tonnage centers, stevedores and ships masters/operators
       (see section 1.3 for more details).

1.2   Field of Application

       This message may be applied for both national and international
       trade. It is based on universal practice and is not dependent
       on the type of business or industry.

1.3   Principles

       In the shipping industry the BAPLIE message can be used between
       partners as indicated below:

       1)  Agent(PD) to agent (NC) 
       2)  Agent(PD) to ships master/operator(PD) 
       3)  Agent(PD) to tonnage centre (PD) 
       4)  Agent(PD) to stevedore (PD) 
       5)  Tonnage centre(PD) to ships master/operator (PD) 
       6)  Tonnage centre(PD) to tonnage centre (NC) 
       7)  Tonnage centre(PD) to stevedore (PD) 
       8)  Stevedore (PD) to tonnage centre (NC) 
       9)  Stevedore (PD) to stevedore (NC) 
       10) Stevedore (PD) to ships master/operator (PD) 
       11) Ships master/operator to tonnage centre (NC) 
       12) Ships master/operator to stevedore (NC) 
       13) Ships master/operator to agent (NC) 
       
       The above gives only one set of communication channels per
       organisation but in practice there will be a combination of one
       or more channels per organisation from or to port of
       departure/next port of call.
       
       - The message will contain only one vessel/voyage combination,
       giving details regarding carrier, mode of transport, means of
       transport, equipment, location on the means of transport, goods
       descriptions and properties of equipment and/or goods.
       
       - The message can be used to transmit information about
       occupied locations on the means of transport, however
       information about empty locations may be added.
       
       - The bayplan message BAPLTE must be used to transmit
       information about total numbers of equipment and quantity of
       goods on a means of transport.
