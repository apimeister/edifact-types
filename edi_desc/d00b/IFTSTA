0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the International
       multimodal status report message (IFTSTA) to be used in
       Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners
       involved in administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message to report the transport status and/or a change in the
       transport status (i.e. event) between agreed parties.

1.2    Field of application

       The International multimodal status report message may be used
       for both national and international applications. It is based
       on universal practice related to administration, commerce and
       transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or
       industry.

1.3    Principles

       This message allows for the exchange of information regarding
       the status of the physical movement of consignments, goods or
       equipment at any point (in time or place) within the full
       transport chain.
       
       A status message may be sent:
       - as the result of request/s for consignment/s or equipment
       status/es
       - on a scheduled basis at predetermined times
       - on the occurrence of a selected event/s
       - on the occurrence of an exceptional event as agreed by the
       partners involved.
       
       This message can relate to a status (or statuses) that has or
       have been reached in a transport chain.
       
       Data requirements for tracking equipment where equipment is not
       associated with a consignment (such as repair container) are
       NOT addressed in this message.
       
       The transport sub-working group (D4) has developed
       recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message
       through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport
       Implementation Guidelines Group).
       Users implementing the message are strongly advised to apply
       these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4
       secretariat.
