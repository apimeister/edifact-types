# Edifact-types
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/edifact-types.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/edifact-types)

This library provides bindings for the Edifact standard.

## Usage

The types should be used inconjuction with a Edifact serializer.

We do recommend the `serde_edifact` crate, since we are using this serializer for testing.

So far, there is also no validation attached to the structs.

## Supported Bindings

None so far.

Something missing? Please open an issue.

## Contributions

Since the Edifact is fairly huge, we only implement types on demand. So if you are missing some types, please open an issue or merge request.
